# The-Train-App
The Train App that allows users to track train arrival times.

# Data Table
This table (The First One You See On The Page) is used to display the data from the Firebase Realtime Database.

# Train Entry Form 
This form is filled out by the user to add an additional train to the database.

# Database Information 
The database is responsible for giving data to the UI. I do not preload any of the UI elements. They are all fetched from the database itself.
